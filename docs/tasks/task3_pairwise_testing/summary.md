# Task #3 Pairwise testing

## What have I learned today?

This time, I learned about the numerous testing frameworks and tools and how they could be combined to a single 
tech-stack for testing the entire mobile application.  
I learned about the [Microsoft PICT tool](https://github.com/microsoft/pict) 
(Pairwise Independent Combinatorial Testing) as well.
I am not sure, if I ever will use in to collect the set of Pairwise testing parameters. However, I will definitely 
remember this tool and would find a proper usage for it.
  
## Result files
- PICT model you used for data generation: [pict_model.txt](../../../task3_pairwise_testing/pict_model.txt)
- PICT raw output: [pict_result.raw](../../../task3_pairwise_testing/pict_result.raw)
- Converted JSON array: [pict_result.json](../../../task3_pairwise_testing/pict_result.json)
- A CSV file that I used to convert PICT raw format to JSON: [pict_result.csv](../../../task3_pairwise_testing/pict_result.csv)
